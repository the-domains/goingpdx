Our inspector suggested that we explore a site called Portland Maps.  It was here that I was first able to look up the history of our house - but only as far back as the 1940's.  ![](https://the-grid-user-content.s3-us-west-2.amazonaws.com/41f850e8-d022-4113-bc2a-dd22900b8688.jpg)

The house was built in the same year that the Wilshire neighborhood in Portland was originally platted, 1921\.  I learned that in the late 1930's, Portland consolidated all of it's neighborhood and provided new addresses to every street in the city.  This meant that there was plenty of history filed under what whatever the original address was including the permits from its original construction.

So I took a trip down to the central library to get my new library card, and do a little bit of research. First impression: this library is beautiful! The first thing you see are two huge trees reaching in every direction above the front doors. I can't wait to see this building again when the foliage is full.

Inside, the front stairs draw your eyes straight to them due to the elaborate etching that looks great from every angle.  There are a few pictures here... but they do not do any justice.  Beyond that - its a typical old city library with gorgeous marble pretty much every where.  It took no time at all to find the third floor history department and the staff found what I was looking for almost immediately.

Apparently, the only records of these older addresses are specifically in the form of an old tome that listed every previous and new address for the whole city.  At first- it seemed like a daunting task but it only took a minute to find our original address.  Turns out, there are only a few streets that changed names. If you look for the closest numbered cross street/avenue you should be able to find yours quickly.  

We've been excited to learn of the original address of the house and learn more about the earliest owners and the beginnings of the neighborhood.  We haven't even moved in yet!
