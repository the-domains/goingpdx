We moved to Portland from Chicago while having never stepped foot in Oregon before.  We had lived in several other major cities previously and spent time in many others on the East Coast.

We moved to Portland and were taken with the familiarity of the city - as well as how delightfully strange it was.  Chicago is proud to boast some of the greatest architecture in the world, but the small craftsman houses of Portland were something unlike anything where we had been before.  We knew immediately that we wanted to live in our own four walls - rather than listening the the sounds of an apartment we had first moved into in the South Waterfront of Portland.

In 2016, we bought a house.  Blown away at our fortune in both finding and financing it, we are looking forward to finally moving in.  Built in 1921,  the house is an original member of the Beaumont-Wilshire neighborhood in Northeast Portland.  

We look forward to meeting the nearly century-old personality of this new home - and restoring (and exploring!) it's craftsman roots.  

This site's purpose is to document parts of that journey - and share just some of the how's and why's along the way.
