We moved to Portland from Chicago without ever having stepped foot in Oregon.  

Immediately, we were taken with the familiarity of the city - as it shared some characteristics of our previous home.  Each neighborhood had its own unique personality and style. While Chicago is proud to boast some of the greatest architecture in the world, the arts & crafts style homes of Portland were too unique to overlook.  We hoped to one day find one of our own.

Upon moving to Portland, we found a great space in South Waterfront, but the neighborhood was underdeveloped and the price was challenging.  We then moved to a great spot off of East Burnside. We were lucky enough to find a perfect apartment, in a great neighborhood, with reasonable rent! This became the perfect base while we looked for a proper home.

We spent several happy years there until we found our home, a little more then two miles away.  Built in 1921, the house is an original member of the Beaumont-Wilshire neighborhood in Northeast Portland.

In an increasingly challenging market we were fortunate to find an amazing old craftsman home. We are so excited to finally have a place to make our own. We are even more excited to meet the nearly century-old personality of this house while restoring its history.

This site's purpose is to document parts of that journey - and share just some of the how's and why's along the way.
